/*[Question.2]  What are the practical applications of a circular linked list? (Try to find applications in your respective fields).
Practical applications of circular linked list are :

1)Circular linked list is used is our Personal Computers, where multiple applications are running.

2)Circular Linked List can also be used to create Circular Queue.

3)Multiplayer games use a circular list to swap between players in a loop.

4)Circular linked lists are used in Round Robin Scheduling

5)Implementation of Advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heap

6)Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word use circular linked list

7)Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.
